# Hello there! ðŸ«¡ I'm Igor Kroeber.
## I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil.

I've been professionally active since 2011, but I'm passionate about coding since I was fourteen.
From the start of my career until now, I've been studying lots of technologies and best practices to develop scalable and reliable code.

I'm open to talk about new open-source projects or just to have a friendly chat while taking a nice cup of coffee!

- #### ðŸ’¼ Open for new Job Positions!
- #### ðŸ”­ Currently working on an open-source agile project management app
